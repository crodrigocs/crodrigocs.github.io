<div class="alert alert-info">
  <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> <strong>Note:</strong> Using Markdown doesn't mean that you can't also use HTML. You can add HTML tags to any Markdown file. This is helpful if you prefer certain HTML tags to Markdown syntax. For example, some people find that it's easier to use HTML tags for images.
